            Only luggage not exceeding 55 x 35 x 20 cm (21.5 x 13.5 x 7.5 inches) can be accepted and must be placed in the lockers after being checked.
            All visitors must comply with the security checks. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience or delay caused by the extra security checks at the entrances.
            In the event of an incident, visitors must vacate the danger zone, alert our security staff and follow their instructions. Visitors may be confined or evacuated to a secure area while waiting for the police to arrive.
